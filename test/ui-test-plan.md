# Moon UI Test Plan

## Test environment

- Run the `Moon` main class with Java 25.
- Compare only text printed by the program. The terminal's echo of typed commands is not part of expected output.
- The test runner stops after the first failing test case.

## Test case: Create and list every task type

**Aim:** Verify that to-dos, deadlines, and events are stored and displayed with their type, details, and incomplete status.

### Input
```text
todo borrow book
deadline return book /by Sunday
event project meeting /from Mon 2pm /to 4pm
list
bye
```

### Expected output
```text

**Aim:** Verify that marking a task done and then unmarking it changes the displayed status correctly.
